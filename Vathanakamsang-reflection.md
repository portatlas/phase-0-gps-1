**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Troubleshooting merge conflicts was an issue I struggled with and tried to avoid prior to this GPS session.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
After working with resolving the merge conflict it became a lot clearer on how I can troubleshoot the issue when it occurs later. Additionally, running into some git command issues was helpful because it forced us to try to troubleshoot the issue.  It was during these sistuations where we were able to get a better understanding of how git works.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I tried to ask my pair question prior to asking our guide. For some instructions I asked my pair if he had the same intepretation.  I also asked a few questions regarding git commands and if they were applicable. Our guide provided us with some additional sublimetext shortcuts which was helpful.

**What still confuses you about git?**
I have been so accustomed to using

    git pull

that I am confused about how I should be using

    git fetch

I think I will have to experiment with git fetch some more for it to make sense to me.

Write now I dont understand the entire mechanism of how git works, but these exercises definitely fill in the pieces.  I think the more that I use git and the less afraid I am to make mistakes the more I will be able to explore all the funcitonality that git offers.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
The first GPS session was good because we were able to get a lot of feedback directly from the instructor. We should have found ways to collobrative more effectively.  Our guide mentioned that we should find more ways to interact and engage with each other during the pairing session.
